# 3308_Final_Submission

Code hosting for the MicroMeteorite site, live at http://142.93.21.74/

Browse our site! Our code is structured as a Linux file system. Find all of our code in the 
directories. Server code is located at /labs/3/MicroCite.  Supplementary resources are 
located at /labs/3/MicroCite/resources. pages and partials are located under /labs/3/MicroCite/views.

As the files are already in a linux tree, if you wish to access an offline version,
you may simply clone the repo, and run the sql setup file located at labs/3/MicroCite/database/create_db_j_edits.sql

Happy meteorite hunting!
